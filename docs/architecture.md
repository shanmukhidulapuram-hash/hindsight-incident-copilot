# Architecture

## High-level flow

```
Azure Monitor / App Insights Alert
        → Context Collector (Functions / webhook)
        → Hindsight Memory Bank (org-incidents)  recall()
        → Reflect + Azure OpenAI reasoning
        → Incident Agent (Agent Framework + HindsightProvider)
        → Teams Adaptive Card / Web UI
        → Engineer approval & resolution
        → Post-Mortem → Hindsight retain() (continuous learning)
```

## Hindsight role

- **Retain** – every resolved incident and post-mortem is stored as structured World / Experience facts and later consolidated into Observations.
- **Recall (TEMPR)** – Semantic + Keyword (BM25) + Entity Graph + Temporal search run in parallel and are fused.
- **Reflect** – the agent reasons over mission, directives and retrieved memories to produce an explainable recommendation.

## Microsoft pieces

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Azure OpenAI | LLM backbone for Reflect and recommendation generation |
| Microsoft Agent Framework | Agent runtime; `HindsightProvider` auto-recalls/retains |
| Azure Monitor + App Insights | Source of live alerts and telemetry context |
| Microsoft Teams | Collaboration surface and adaptive-card approvals |
| Azure AI Search (optional) | Hybrid retrieval alongside Hindsight |
| Microsoft Fabric / ADX | Historical incident analytics and MTTR dashboards |
| Azure Container Apps / AKS | Host agent + Hindsight |

## Security & audit

- Every recommendation is logged (who asked, which memories were used, timestamp).
- Engineer approval is required before any automated remediation.
- Memory banks can be scoped per team / service for isolation.
